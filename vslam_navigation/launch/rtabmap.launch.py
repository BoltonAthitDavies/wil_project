"""RTAB-Map as a loop-closure back-end behind VINS or ORB-SLAM3, on the sim bags.

Starts two things and nothing else:

  rtab_camera_shim.py   decompresses the bag's stereo pair and manufactures the
                        camera_info + static TF that the bags do not carry
  rtabmap_slam/rtabmap  the mapper, taking odometry from whichever front-end you
                        are running in another terminal

There is deliberately NO odometry node here. RTAB-Map's own visual odometry
(rtabmap_odom) is the thing we are replacing -- the rtabmap node always takes
its pose from the `odom` topic, so simply not launching an odometry node is
what puts VINS or ORB-SLAM3 in that role. (`visual_odometry:=false` is an
argument of the upstream rtabmap_launch wrapper, not a parameter of this node;
passing it here would do nothing.)

Like every other launch file in this workspace, this one does NOT play a bag.

    # terminal 1   front-end
    ros2 launch vins_fusion_ros2 vins_fusion_ros2.launch.py
    # terminal 2   this
    ros2 launch ./rtab_sim.launch.py
    # terminal 3   data
    ros2 bag play dataset/static_dataset_loop --rate 0.5

NOTE the missing --clock. These bags RECORD /clock (74180 messages), so adding
--clock makes rosbag2 publish a second, wall-epoch clock on top of it. The two
disagree by ~1.79e9 s, tf2 logs "Detected jump back in time" and clears its
buffer thousands of times, and RTAB-Map never resolves a camera transform.

For ORB-SLAM3 instead, override the two frame/topic arguments:

    ros2 launch vslam_navigation rtabmap.launch.py \
        odom_frame:=orbslam3_world body_frame:=base_footprint \
        output_path:=output/output_orb_rtab/simulation/dataset_dynamic_000
